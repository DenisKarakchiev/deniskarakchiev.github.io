Hello, my name is Denis, i'm from Russia and i really want to learn programming through web.

That's why i'm started this small project, where i'm trying to learn front-end development from scratch and on my own. Started from learning a simple Html to using most popular frameworks like Bootstrap, Sass preprocessor, and finally, to JavaScript, Php, and other languages and technologies needed to work as a Front-end Developer.

I want to use only those technologies that I quite understood and can be used in the work.

This project is public, but in fact it's just for my convenience.
By the way, I'll be glad, if that repository will help you out how the Web works.
